## Overview
This Rust program generates and prints all subgroups of the additive group $\mathbb{Z}_n$. The additive group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ consists of integers $n$, with addition as the group operation. The subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ are cyclic subgroups generated by the divisors of $n$. For each divisor of $n$, there is a corresponding cyclic subgroup. This program computes all such subgroups for a given $n$ and sorts them.

## Features
- Divisors Calculation: The program computes all divisors of a given number $n$, which are required to generate subgroups.
-  Subgroup Generation: For each divisor, a corresponding subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is generated using an appropriate generator.
-  Display Subgroups: The program prints all distinct subgroups in a sorted manner.

## How It Works
- **divisors(n: u64) -> Vec<u64>:** Computes and returns a vector of all divisors of the integer $n$.
- **generate_subgroup(n: u64, generator: u64) -> HashSet<u64>:** Generates and returns the subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ using a given generator. The subgroup is returned as a HashSet to ensure uniqueness of elements.
- **generate_all_subgroups(n: u64) -> Vec<HashSet<u64>>:** Generates and returns a vector of all distinct subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Each subgroup is computed by iterating over all divisors of $n$ and generating subgroups using appropriate generators.
- The main function defines a value for $n$ and uses the above functions to compute all subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_n$. The subgroups are then printed in sorted order for clarity.

  ## Installation

- To use this project, you need to have Rust installed on your machine.
- If Rust is not installed, follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install it.
- After installing Rust, clone this repository or copy the code into a Rust project, Compile and run the code using cargo run.
## Usage
- To use this code, you can clone the repository.
- You can change the values of $n$ and $m$ in the main function to test different cases.
- Compile the Rust code using cargo:
>```
>cargo build
>cargo run
- This will compile and run the program, printing the subgroups of the specified $\mathbb{Z}_n$.
## Customizing
- To compute subgroups for a different value of $n$, simply modify the value of $n$ in the main function.
## Example Output
>```
>Subgroups of Z_24:
>[0]
>[0, 12]
>[0, 8, 16]
>[0, 6, 12, 18]
>[0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20]
>[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]
>[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]
- This output lists all subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$, with each subgroup represented as a sorted list of elements.
